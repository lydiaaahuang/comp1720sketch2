# Artist Statement

My interactive window is inspired by Disney's classic Alice in Wonderland. I wanted
to fuse the realities of lock down with my favourite Disney movie. The initial image
shows Alice in dark room alone eating. The dim and dull colours create a sense of 
sadness and loneliness, a common emotion felt during lock down. The interactive clock
shows how time continues to pass while we are on 'pause.' 

Using interactive elements, I wanted to show that wonder is always with us. I chose
to make these interactive and hidden as wonder isn't always displayed and we have to
look for it. However, with interactive elements it can be difficult for users to find certain
elements for example key press 'w'. 

When the 'w' is pressed, the room turns to Wonderland. Juxtaposing the
prior image with bright and vibrant colours. Alice is accompanied by the Mad Hatter, as it
is important to have support during lock down and keep up our social life. 

The window is a look into how lock down can be depressing for many people but if 
we find the wonder in everyday chores we can find a bit of happiness. I hope users are
able to understand and find this message through my window.
